      <p style="font-size: 3em;">Who am I?</p>
      <img class="personalpic" src="img/personalpic.png">
      <p>I am Bryan, an aspiring technoprenur pursuing a Diploma in Information Technology in Ngee Ann Polytechnic.<br>
        I'm passionate in creating technological solutions to solve real-world problems, as I was born a problem solver.<br><br>
        <i><b>My life mission is to create something that impacts the world, no matter big or small.</i></b><br><br>
        I have embarked on a project to help the visually impaired make e-payments, as the current solutions don't include such people, leaving them out.<br>
        Doing this project would mean that I would be one step closer to make an impact on the world.<br><br>
        To get me to my goal, I would be interested in going for an internship focused on the back-end stuff, where the problem solving happens.

      <p style="font-size:3em;">A Brief History</p>
      <p>A true-blue Singaporean, born and raised in Singapore to a beautiful single-mother.<br>
        My passion for Information Technology sparked when I was at a tender age 7 years old, with my first exposure to computers.<br>
        Since then, I never stopped chasing my passion, which resulted in the person I am today, a software engineer aspiring to start a technology business to change the way we live.

      <i>I don't just live within the confines of the screen, I love venturing out too!</i>
      <p>During my free-time, I like to explore the world by travelling, which has took me to places like China, solo.<br>
      I also like to dedicate some of my time to volunteer work at the Singapore Red Cross, as I love to help others and make their day better.<br>
